# AGENTS.md (Project-wide)

These instructions apply to the entire repository unless overridden by a more specific AGENTS.md.

## Project Context
- Product: Digitales Fundbüro (Kundenservice)
- Stack targets: Angular 21, Spring Boot 4.0.1 (Gradle), PostgreSQL 17.4, JDK 25, Docker/Docker-Compose, GitHub Actions.

## General Engineering Guidelines
- Prefer small, well-scoped changes with clear intent.
- Keep configuration and code aligned with the target stack versions.
- Use clear, German-facing labels for UI text unless otherwise requested.

## Licensing & Images (Critical)
- Always explicitly call out any potential license issues or risks with images/assets or third‑party dependencies.
- Avoid introducing unlicensed or unclear assets. If an asset’s license is uncertain, flag it and propose alternatives.

## Documentation
- Keep docs concise and in the same language as the surrounding documentation.
- Update docs only when explicitly asked or when necessary to reflect changes.
